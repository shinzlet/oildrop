# oildrop
A tiny userscript manager that you can self-audit and fully trust.

## Browser extensions have access to all of your data
So you should be very picky with which ones you'll install.

There are plenty of well-made, fully featured userscript managers that
already exist. However, the number of features they offer mean that they are too
big for a single end-user to easily audit (>> 10k sloc, typically). This means
you have to trust that no malicious code has been slipped into them.

Oildrop takes the alternative approach - it is designed to provide only the
most essential features, while keeping a small, clean codebase. The core goal
of Oildrop is that anyone who is slightly familiar with Javascript can read all
of its code in less than ten minutes.
