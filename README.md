Over the recent years, I've fallen out of love with browser extensions. Their
permission lists always seem mysterious, and it's hard to know what they do with
your data.

Due to concerns like this, many popular browser extensions are open source and
community built. I'm a fan of that, but I don't have the dedication needed
to examine their codebases - many userscript and userstyle managers have
tens of thousands of lines of code.

As a response, I built Oildrop: a userscript manager designed to be audited by
anyone in less than twenty minutes.

## Features
- Sleek, modern interface
- Manage scripts and styles in one extension
- Dark and light theme
- Import / Export your scripts with JSON
- GPLv3 Licence
