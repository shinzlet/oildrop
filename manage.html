                <p>
                    By exporting your data, you can save your Oildrop scripts and settings to a file on your computer. This
                    can later be imported to restore your configuration, or to share your scripts.
                </p>
                <button id="export" title="Download your oildrop configuration as a file.">Export</button>

            <section>
                <h2>Import</h2>
                <p>
                    Here, you can import data that was previously exported from Oildrop. "Overwrite" will
                    replace your current configuration with the data file - erasing your scripts and settings in the process.
                    "Load Scripts" will leave your existing data in place, and install scripts from the data file alongside
                    your existing ones.
                </p>
